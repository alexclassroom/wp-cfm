For security reasons, please report all security issues via either an email to wordpress@forumon.com or via a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/forumone/wp-cfm/security/advisories).

Please disclose responsibly and not via GitHub Issues or WordPress.org Forum posts (which allows for exploiting issues in the wild before the patch is released).
